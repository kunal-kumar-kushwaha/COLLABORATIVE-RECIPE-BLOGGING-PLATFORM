# COLLABORATIVE-RECIPE-BLOGGING-PLATFORM
 The creation of a blogging platform where individuals can share their favourite dishes, allowing others to learn and try them out.


OBJECTIVE
The idea for this platform was conceived when attempting to cook a regional dish, dosa, which is not commonly known in the northern part of India. Despite searching on YouTube, there was a lack of comprehensive information. This led to the creation of a blogging platform where individuals can share their favorite dishes, allowing others to learn and try them out.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
The platform was built using Node.js and MongoDB. The layout was designed with Bootstrap, and various NPM packages were utilized, including connect-flash, cookie- parser, dotenv, ejs, express, express-ejs-layouts, express-fileupload, express-session, and mongoose.

MAIN FEATURES
• A welcoming homepage displaying various recipes categorized as latest recipes, Indian recipes, Mexican recipes, etc.
• Detailed views of recipes, providing step-by-step instructions and ingredient lists.
• A search bar for users to find recipes quickly.
• A submission tab for users to publish their recipes, requiring details like email,
recipe name, image, description, ingredients, and preparation methods.

CHALLENGES
The main challenges faced were collecting a vast number of recipes, issues with MongoDB (especially the Categories collection), and determining how to store and submit articles. There were also concerns about potential spam and the need for enhanced security.

OUTCOME
Despite the challenges, the project was successful, fulfilling its objective and providing a valuable learning experience.
